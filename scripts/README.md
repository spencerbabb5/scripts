ELK-STAK PROJECT
linux and ansible scripts

In this lab we were tasked to act as a cloud administrator, to get a system set up for a new cybersecurity analyst. 

-In this project we had to set up an azure enviorment with a jump box provisioner and Web 1-3. 
-The diagram is to show the network topology and how the system would have been set up in this cloud enviorment for the project.
-The ansible file shows the configuration within our docker.io containers to be able to install filebeat and metric beat.
-As for the linux file we were instructed to gather all linux scripts that we had done in all weeks prior to the project and file them there.
We then with our newly set up coud enviorment explored kibana and what filebeat and metricbeat did with kibana.
