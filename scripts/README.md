ELK-STAK PROJECT
linux and ansible scripts

In this lab we were tasked to act as a cloud administrator, to get a system set up for a new cybersecurity analyst. 

-In this project we had to set up an azure enviorment with a jump box provisioner and Web 1-3. 
-The diagram is to show the network topology and how the system would have been set up in this cloud enviorment for the project.
-The ansible file shows the configuration within our docker.io containers to be able to install filebeat and metric beat.
